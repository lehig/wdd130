        <h1>House Atreides</h1>
        <p>
          House Atreides origins, according to legend, start in Greece on Old
          Earth. Specifically claiming to be descendants of King Aggamemnon, a
          son of Atreus. House Atreides made its prominence during the Butlerian
          Jihad, a war to destroy all thinking machines, and continued to be one
          of the major houses in the Padishah Empire. Until Leto Atreides, House
          Atreides called Caladan home for over 20 generations. House Atreides
          became the ruling house of the empire, and ended after 3,500 years,
          when Leto Atriedes II ended the Atreides Empire.

        <h2>Paul Atreides</h2>
        <p>
          Paul Atreides is the main character that Frank Herbert introduces in
          Dune and where we begin our journey into the universe created. He is
          the son of Duke Leto Atreides I and Bene Gesserit concubine Lady
          Jessica. He starts his life on a planet called Caladan where his
          family, being royalty, had dominion over. In the beginnings of the
          book the family gets dominion over a planet called Arrakis by the
          Emperor. This puts Paul in contact with the native population of
          Arrakis, the Fremen.

        <h1>House Harkonnen</h1>
        <p>
          House Harkonnen was a great house during the Padishah Empire. Their
          base of operations and capital was Geidi Prime, which had very little
          photosynthetic potential. House Harkonnen was known for their
          underhanded and savvy politcal moves and for their feud with House
          Atreides. House Harkonnen also had a reputation for being brutal and
          holding resentment. House Harkonnen was once in control of Arrakis,
          until the Emperor gave the feif to House Atreides. This didn't last
          long after, and soon they invaded and took control of Arrakis, finally
          losing it to Paul Atreides.

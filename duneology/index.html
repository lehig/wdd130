          Dune, being a vast and quite complex universe that involves so many
          organizations, parties, creeds and peoples. This expansive and
          somtimes confusing universe can be daunting for some poeple,
          especially for those just barely getting into it as well as anyone who
          already knows much about the universe. This site is to help put it all
          into order starting from the beginning, to explaining the end, and
          everything in between. We hope to make it easy and interactive so that
          everyone, from beginners to those with decades of loving the universe,
          can come and learn something new about Dune.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I know a bit about websites and design. I also love Dune. Dune, if you know it, 
        is somewhat expansive and carries a lot of story in it. Something that I’ve noticed a 
        lot while looking things up for Dune is that there isn’t much in the way of connecting all the story 
        elements and making it easier to see how the story unfolds. That’s why I think there should be an interactive
        website where you can more clearly see the story, from beginning to end. I want to help more people
        understand the story behind Dune and build a website that’ll be easy to use and informative.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Those who are both new to Dune, or might not even know what it is, as well as those who have been 
        following Dune since it came out in 1965 should find this site helpful. Exploring the world that Frank Herbert 
        created and also help with putting the story together in an interactive way. This should be a place where everyone 
        who want to maybe dip their toes in it, or who have fallen in love with it, can come to see the story pan out in 
        a unique way.

      <h4>The Intro</h4><p>
        Dune, being a vast and quite complex universe that involves so many organizations, parties, creeds and peoples. 
        This expansive and somtimes confusing universe can be daunting for some poeple, especially for those just barely getting into it
        as well as anyone who already knows much about the universe. This site is to help put it all into order starting from the beginning, to explaining
        the end, and everything in between. We hope to make it easy and interactive so that everyone, from beginners to those with decades of loving
        the universe, can come and learn something new about Dune. 
      </p>

      <h4>Timeline</h4>
      <p>
        House Atreides is in control of Caladan. The Emperor then gives House Atreides control of Arrakis. Shortly after the reign of House 
        Atreides, House Harkonnen commences a seige against House Atreides, taking control of all spice operations and capturing Leto 
        Atreides. Leto Atreides dies in a failed assassination attempt against Baron Harkonnen, leader of House Harkonnen. House Harkonnen
        takes control of Arrakis for the second time. Paul then becomes part of the Fremen and the Muad'dib and has a child with Chani Kynes, 
        a fremen, whose name is Leto Atreides II.

      <h3>Houses</h3>
      <h4>House Atreides</h4>
      <p>
        House Atreides origins, according to legend, start in Greece on Old Earth. Specifically claiming to be descendants of King 
        Aggamemnon, a son of Atreus. House Atreides made its prominence during the Butlerian Jihad, a war to destroy all thinking machines, 
        and continued to be one of the major houses in the Padishah Empire. Until Leto Atreides, House Atreides called Caladan home for over 20 
        generations. House Atreides became the ruling house of the empire, and ended after 3,500 years, when Leto Atriedes II ended the Atreides 
        Empire. 
      </p>

      <h4>Paul Atreides</h4>
      <p>
        Paul Atreides is the main character that Frank Herbert introduces in Dune and where we begin our journey into the universe created. 
        He is the son of Duke Leto Atreides I and Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica. He starts his life on a planet called Caladan where 
        his family, being royalty, had dominion over. In the beginnings of the book the family gets dominion over a planet called Arrakis by 
        the Emperor. This puts Paul in contact with the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen. 
      </p>

      <h4>Leto Atreides I</h4>
      <p>
        Leto Atreides I was the father of Paul Atreides, was also know as "Leto the Just", or the "Red Duke". He was well known for his fairhandedness 
        and compassionate leadership. He was the 20th duke of House Atreides. Leto was at war with the Harkonnens while he ruled Caladan, and later
        Arrakis by order of the Emperor.

      <h3>House Harkonnen</h3>
      <p>
        House Harkonnen was a great house during the Padishah Empire. Their base of operations and capital was Geidi Prime, which had very little 
        photosynthetic potential. House Harkonnen was known for their underhanded and savvy politcal moves and for their feud with House Atreides. 
        House Harkonnen also had a reputation for being brutal and holding resentment. House Harkonnen was once in control of Arrakis, until the 
        Emperor gave the feif to House Atreides. This didn't last long after, and soon they invaded and took control of Arrakis, finally losing it 
        to Paul Atreides.
